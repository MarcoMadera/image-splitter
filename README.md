# Image Splitter

I need to split some images and I have chosen the web to do it. Splitting images into a grid and downloading the split images as a ZIP file

- Upload an image.
- Specify rows and columns for the grid.
- View the grid overlay on the uploaded image.
- Download the split images as a ZIP file.
